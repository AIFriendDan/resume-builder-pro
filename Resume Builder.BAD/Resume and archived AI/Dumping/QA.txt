1. What’s your professional background in a nutshell?

I’ve spent the past eight years in IT operations and support, specializing in Microsoft 365, Okta, MFA, Atlassian, Slack, and LastPass. I’ve moved from tactical support to strategic platform stewardship, with a strong focus on documentation, enablement, and process improvement.

2. What kind of role are you targeting next?

I’m looking for a remote, mid-level individual contributor role focused on Microsoft 365 administration (especially Exchange and OneDrive), Okta and MFA, documentation, and enablement. I want autonomy, technical depth, and a healthy work-life balance.

3. What do you love most about working in IT?

I love solving technical puzzles and making systems run smoother. There’s something deeply satisfying about turning chaos into clarity—whether it’s streamlining a workflow, documenting a process, or enabling a team with the right tools.

4. How do you handle last-minute changes or unexpected challenges?

I handle last-minute schedule changes graciously and with empathy. I understand that unexpected things—whether personal or professional—can disrupt even the best-laid plans. I try to convey that understanding in my tone and response, reassuring the other person that it’s okay and we can reschedule for whatever works best for them. I also reframe the situation for myself: that time is now a gift, and I can use it productively elsewhere.

5. How do you approach collaboration, especially with diverse teams?

Over the past eight years working with enterprise and international teams, I’ve learned that true value comes from collaboration—especially when opinions and work styles differ. If everyone thinks the same, we only get one kind of result. Diverse perspectives help us cover more ground and create better outcomes. I genuinely enjoy working in groups and thrive on that dynamic.

6. How do you stay organized and manage your time effectively?

I’m a big fan of using my Outlook calendar to stay organized. I rely on high-performing techniques like time boxing and the Pomodoro method to manage my day. I work in focused one-hour bursts to maintain attention and break larger tasks into manageable chunks. I actually prefer a fast-paced environment—it’s where I feel most energized and productive.

7. How do you stay motivated and productive during long-term projects or when facing repetitive tasks?

I stay on track with regular check-ins and visual tools like org charts and graphs. I’m all about ticking off tasks and reporting progress—it’s my jam. Tools like Planner and Jira keep me deadline-focused. Honestly, I’m wired to stay motivated. The challenge is slowing down, not speeding up.

8. How do you ensure clear communication when working across teams or with remote collaborators?

I always find myself in the internal comms lane—and I love it. I’ve picked up great habits from pro-level communicators, like keeping things jargon-free and audience-aware. I double-check expectations and ask for confirmation to make sure what I said is what was heard. That’s the sweet spot for smooth collaboration.

9. Can you share an example of a time you solved a complex problem or overcame a challenge at work?

At my last job, I tackled a long-standing IT onboarding issue. New hires didn’t get their laptops until day two or three because the company believed they couldn’t create accounts before seeing physical proof of citizenship. I knew from past experience with CMMC 2.0 compliance that this wasn’t necessary. It took three months of meetings, rapport-building, and a few rejections, but I finally got the SOP rewritten. IT could now stage accounts ahead of time—and we nailed day-one readiness for the first time ever.

10. What do you value most in a workplace culture or team environment?

I value team cultures that are optimistic, curious, and solution-oriented. When egos are set aside and collaboration is driven by synergy and a sense of fun, great things happen. I thrive in environments where people approach challenges with open minds and positive energy.

11. What kind of role or work environment helps you do your best work?

Remote work at Teladoc was my sweet spot: quiet room, palm tree views, and no distractions. I work in one-hour bursts, then take quick walks to reset. Give me three monitors, a bunch of windows, and a fast-paced flow of tasks—I’m in my element.

12. What motivates you to keep growing professionally, and how do you pursue that growth?

Over the past five years, I’ve gone through a major personal growth journey. I returned to college to finish my degree in Information Technology, then earned a Master’s in Business and Information Systems to strengthen areas I saw in other leaders. That experience built real confidence in me. I’m driven by a built-in desire to push limits, lead from the front, and embrace failure as part of growth. I’m a lifelong learner who loves taking classes and exploring new skills—especially when the resources are just a search away.

13. What strengths or qualities make you a valuable contributor to a team or organization?

My strengths lie in clear communication, collaborative leadership, and emotional intelligence. I strike a balance between professionalism, empathy, and humor—often bringing energy and positivity to team interactions. I’m known for being easy to work with and great at facilitating productive meetings. My IT background, attention to detail, and love of methodical documentation help me break down complex tasks and ask the right questions to move work forward.

14. What are you looking for in your next role, and what kind of impact do you hope to make?

I’m looking for a role that supports both professional excellence and personal well-being. That means a healthy work-life balance, a positive and encouraging atmosphere, and the flexibility to work from home so I can care for my 10-year-old son. I thrive under leadership that holds me accountable while genuinely caring about my growth and well-being. My goal is to contribute meaningfully while maintaining a high quality of life.
